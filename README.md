## Running The App
This app runs with expo.
If you are not familiar with expo, I recommend this article:  
https://docs.expo.dev/  
To launch the app run `expo start` in you CLI.  
This opens a localhost browser and allows the selection of what emulator you want to use.

### Device Set Up
Download the Expo app on the device you want to use to run the app. \
With your device, scan QR code (Android) or send a link via email (iOS) to connect to expo. \
The app will start on your device and you'll be able to use it.
